        <h1>Unraveling The Spiral</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Term ‘Spiraling’ has many interchangeable names such as ‘Catastrophic Thinking,’ ‘The Upward/Downward Spiral,’ and ‘The Anxiety Spiral.’  As well as the many forms this term can take on, it can generate even more varying definitions.  To deepen our understanding of ourselves and our experiences of comfort or lack of comfort while spiraling, this website intends to expand upon the orginial survey titled, ‘Subject:Spiraling,’ conducted on September 09/25/2021 with an increased number of inquiries.
